This is our C project for our first year at Telecom Nancy.
The subject is described in french in the report. 

To compile this you project, you'll need some extra libraries:

- libsdl2-dev 
- libsdl2-image-dev
- libsdl2-ttf-dev 
- libsdl2-mixer-dev

After that, you just have to launch the command make and let magic be done ;) <br />
The executable Game will be created at the root of the directory.

The default keys are : 

- [Space] Launch a spell
- [Directionnal arrows] Move the hero
- [a] [z] [e] Switch the spell
